# The command line

You may not have worked with the command line before, but if you continue in computational research, it's destined to be something you spend a lot of time with. And probably - something you'll eventually enjoy using!

## Getting started on the command line

### Using the command line on a Mac

On a Mac, you have very few steps before you're up and running on the command line! All you need to do is to open up `Terminal`. This is a program on MacOS that communicates directly with the computer, so that you can send commands and run programs.

    A terminal emulator is an application that provides text-based commands to the computer, without some graphical user interface (GUI). In the case of your Mac, the terminal emulator takes the place of the clean graphics of the ribbon at the bottom of your screen and the icons arranged on your desktop. Rather than a double click starting a program, you explicitly send the command of what to do to the machine!

### Using the command line on Windows

In Windows, you can run commands through the **Command Prompt**, which you may have used before. You can access the command prompt using the `Run` application by typing "cmd", or through any search bar via typing "cmd" or "Command Prompt".
