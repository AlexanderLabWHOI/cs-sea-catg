# Welcome to WHOI, and to the Alexander Lab!

We are excited to have you on board, but there is a ton to learn about how to:
- Get started with Poseidon and the command line
- Use command-line tools and software
- Exploit workflow management software like `Snakemake` to make your life easier

And much more! This website is meant to serve as a central location where you can find all of the information you need to make your time here successful, since a lot of the projects involve a good amount of coding and use of the Poseidon HPC system.
